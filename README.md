# Priority Queue
[![Python application](https://github.com/dinosoupy/priority-queue/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dinosoupy/priority-queue/actions/workflows/python-app.yml)

This is an implementation of a priority queue using a max-heap from scratch. It was written to simulate an M/M/c queuing system (single queue multiple server) for an assignment. Right now it only supports discrete priority values and maintains max-heap property at the time of enqueue() or dequeue(). 

## Improvements
I plan to add the following features:
- [ ] Implement `heapify()` to construct heap from existing array
- [ ] Error handling for overflow/underflow during heap operations
